This function uses an if statement to check if `n` is negative or greater than or equal to zero. If it is negative, an exception is raised and the function returns 1 instead. If it is zero, the function returns 1. Otherwise, it calculates the factorial using the formula n * (n-1) for each iteration and returns the final value."
